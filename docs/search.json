    "text": "All content select by TAG\n\n\nA comment in the margin with a bunch of text:\n\nThe Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.\n\nThe creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed at Rational Software in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996.\n\nIn 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML. In software engineering, most practitioners do not use UML, but instead produce informal hand drawn diagrams; these diagrams, however, often include elements from UML."

    "text": "About SOMA - Asset Monitoring Oriented System\n\nIndustry 4.0 technologies applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of machines and equipments\nOne of the main challenges for companies in managing their assets is the translation of large masses of monitoring data into useful information for maintenance managers. The solution for this is the adoption of automated monitoring systems, which aim to provide reliable access to information on the status of monitored assets, support decision-making, bring efficiency gains and remove the risk of human error.\nAs a result of extensive experience in monitoring and evaluating assets in the electricity sector, SOMA implements and makes available, in the companies’ Web environment, a Maintenance 4.0 architecture. Applying Industry 4.0 concepts to Maintenance Engineering , SOMA adopts technologies that include Internet of Things, state-of-the-art cybersecurity, digital twins , integration with other systems and cloud computing.\nSOMA is a flexible, robust and reliable system, focused on helping the management of physical assets, and which can be used to monitor various industrial processes. SOMA’s functionalities range from online monitoring of the equipment’s operating status by a maintenance technician to the diagnosis of its condition by a specialist engineer."
